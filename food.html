        <h1>Eggs benny and pizza and pastries, oh my!</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Kate is a wanna-be foodie. She loves to eat.</p>
        <p>In 2018 she discovered eggs benedict and her life hasn't been the same since. At least twice a month when she lived in Framingham she would go to <a href="https://www.jmdiner.com/our-menu#menu=menu&item=baby-benny">J&M Diner</a> for breakfast before work. She whole-heartedly believes she kept J&M Diner afloat during the pandemic when restaurants could only serve takeout. Every Sunday from March through June, she would order eggs benedict with extra hollandaise, a side of bacon, and an ice cream float. (Kinda funny looking back on it because Kate doesn't eat pig products now...) The girls at the diner affectionately called her "eggs benny girl" and used photos Kate took of her breakfasts and posted them to their social media accounts. Kate was very proud. She went back to the diner for breakfast several months after she moved and the girls still remembered her. </p>
        <p>Fortunately for Darby's Bakery and unfortunately for both Kate's wallet and waistline, she discovered the yummiest focaccia pizza ever. If Kate times it just right, she take home a fresh-right-outta-the-oven BBQ chicken focaccia pizza with homemade BBQ sauce. It is drool-worthy. Kate used to visit Darby's once a week but now she only goes once a month. Balance, ya know?</p>
        <p>Kate tries hard to eat healthy 70% of the time. She's eating a lot more vegetables now that she isn't eating red meat or pork. She uses Home Chef and EveryPlate to try new recipes. But honestly, Kate really just loves when someone else makes food for her. Here's a collection of her favorite foods she's made and that others have made for her.</p>
