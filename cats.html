        <h1>What's with all the gray cats?</h1>
        <p>Kate has had 9 gray cats throughout her life. Crazy, huh?</p>
        <h2>The OG Kats</h2>
        <p>When Kate was born, she wasn't the apple of her parents' eyes. They already had two apples: Teddy and Smokey, a bonded pair of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=korat&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS937US937&sxsrf=AOaemvKZpriGVO28A6xd4QGDqB_-5pWV-Q:1632966736809&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAw5uSy6XzAhVmlmoFHcy1AhoQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=577&dpr=1.5">Korat</a> kitties adopted from the same breeder in Georgia 5 years before. Kate's parents took Teddy and Smokey to cat shows, where they won first place in their divisions for many years. They passed within a few months of each other in 2007-2008.</p>
        <h2>Kate's Kitty</h2>
        <p>In 2002, Kate's family adopted Buddy, a distant relative of Teddy and Smokey. Buddy was Kate's kitty. When her dad came home from the airport with their newest gray cat, the family sat in different areas of the living room to see where Buddy would go first. Kate waited patiently and hoped he would come to her. And what do you know? He did! Kate and Buddy were inseparable until his death just 5 days before Kate's 21st birthday.</p>
        <h2>Bekah's Cat</h2>
        <p>The gray cat trend continued in 2007 with the adoption of Kodie. Kate's dad ran a newsletter for fellow Korat lovers and an older gentleman reached out to him and asked if he knew of any potential families looking for a kitten. His kitten was a "problem" for his wife and her diabetes. Kodie would nibble her feet at night and make them bleed and she couldn't feel it because of her diabetes. Kate's dad took one look at his picture and drove to Andover, Massachusetts to bring him home that day. Kodie picked Bekah, Kate's younger sister. He will be 15 next March.</p>
        <h2>The Gray Twins</h2>
        <p>Calvin and Hobbes joined the gray train in December 2012 during Kate's freshman year of college. These two kitties could not be more opposite. Hobbes is 6 pounds and fearless. Calvin is 12 pounds and a true scaredy-cat. They love laying in front of the slider getting sun with Kodie. The "twins" just turned 9.</p>
        <h2>Puff a Luff</h2>
        <p>Kate's dad rescued Shadow in summer 2014. He was living outside in Arizona because his humans were going through a divorce and neither could take care of him. Shadow was earth-side for only 1,234 days after he arrived at the Domenichella's. His last 1,234 days on earth were full of love, sunshine, a warm bed of towels, and an endless supply of Kate's mom's half and half.</p>
        <h2>8 & 9</h2>
        <p>Kate moved out in August 2017. She spent 25 months without any gray kitties except for the visits she'd make to her parents' house. One day, she said to the universe, "Hey, I'm ready for a cat. It's my turn now". The next day, her college roommate, Alexis, the associate ACO in Fairhaven, Massachusetts texted Kate and asked if this gray kitten they had just found roaming the streets was a Korat like her parents' cats. Kate knew the kitten wasn't but she was in love. Alexis asked if Kate's parents were interested in adopting the gray kitten and his brother! Kate quickly said, "I don't care if they are. Those boys are mine!" Kate was up until 2 AM the day before the adoption cleaning her apartment to prepare for her boys. The morning of the adoption, Kate woke up at 6 AM to clean some more. She threw up twice from nerves. Her coworker picked her up and drove her the 90ish minutes to Fairhaven to bring her babies home. Kate has learned a lot these past two years about caring for animals. She's grateful to Gammy and Gampy, her parents, for their guidance and wisdom. They are great role models.</p>
